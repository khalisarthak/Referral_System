System Architecture Overview

    1. System Components
        The system is built with a combination of a backend REST API (Node.js/Express), a frontend application (React), and WebSocket integration for real-time notifications. It allows users to make purchases, receive earnings based on a referral system, and view purchase and earnings data. The system also includes a WebSocket server for pushing notifications to the user regarding earnings.


    2. Technologies Used
        - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (for database interactions)
        - Frontend: React.js
        - Database: MySQL (using Sequelize as an ORM)
        - WebSocket: Socket.io for real-time notifications
        - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
        - Version Control: Git (GitHub or GitLab)
    3. System Flow
        User Registration & Authentication: Users can sign up and log in. JWT is used for authentication and maintaining user sessions.
        Purchase Process: Users can make purchases, and based on their referral status, earnings are distributed to the parent users.
        Real-Time Notifications: Whenever earnings are updated due to a purchase, the userâ€™s parent receives a WebSocket notification.
        Purchase & Earnings Tracking: The system stores purchase data and earnings for each user, which can be retrieved and displayed.
